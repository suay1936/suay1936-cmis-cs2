# Make a game that 
# Write a description of what your script will do first. This description can be written in gedit and used as the basis of your code later. See this example.
# name the file conditionals.py
# 2 conditional execution 
#2 alternative execution 
#2 chained conditionals 
#Use raw_input.
#Use good variable names.
#Use type conversion when necessary.
#Define at least 4 functions that do something substantial (not just adding 2 numbers or multiplying). At least 1 must return a boolean value and be used as a part of the flow control. At least one must return an integer or float. At least 1 must return a string. The 4th can do what ever you want.
#Define a main() function to organize the flow of your program. Be sure to think about the three phases (input, processing, output)
#Use at least 3 different relational operators.
#Use each of the logical operators at least once. 
#Use random.random() and random.randint() at least once each in your script.
#Use str.format() at least once in your script.
#Use """ or ''' strings at least once in your script.
#Write an interesting and/or entertaining story/game.
#My Game
# My game that will tell you at what age you will die and how you will die
# It will ask for your current age
# It will ask you if you have ever been in any accidents that require multiple days in the hospital and what age were you when this happened
# It will ask you if you have participated in any extreme activities or would like to
# find a list of extreme activities: bungee jumping, creeking, 
# It will ask you questions about how you spend your daily life
# It will ask you how you plan to spend your future; where you want to go; what you want to do
#Use the same structure we learned about in the simple program assignment.
