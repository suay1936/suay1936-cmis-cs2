#Section 1: Terminology
# 1) What is a recursive function?
#A recursive function will continue on producing an output unless there is a condition to make it stop. #point
#
#
# 2) What happens if there is no base case defined in a recursive function?
#The recursive will continue on recursing that function. #point
#
#
# 3) What is the first thing to consider when designing a recursive function?
#You consider the base case function.#point
#
#
# 4) How do we put data into a function call?
#You type it in the parentheses of function. #point
#
# 
# 5) How do we get data out of a function call?
#You get data out of a function call by giving a variable to the data from the function call that is to be called. #no point
#
#

#Section 2: Reading
# Read the following function definitions and function calls.
# Then determine the values of the variables q1-q20.

#a1 = 1 + (2, 5) no point
#a2 = 1 + (6, 1) 
#a3 = 1 + (-1, -2)

#b1 = 2
#b2 = 1 + (1, 0) no
#b3 = 1 + (-1, 0) no

#c1 = 1 + (-2, 2) no
#c2 = 4 
#c3 = 10 + (5, 4) no 

#d1 = 6
#d2 = 1 + (3, 1, 3) no
#d3 = 1 - (2, 2, 1) no

#Section 3: Programming
#Write a script that asks the user to enter a series of numbers.
#When the user types in nothing, it should return the average of all the odd numbers
#that were typed in. 
#In your code for the script, add a comment labeling the base case  on the line BEFORE the base case.
#Also add a comment label BEFORE the recursive case.
#It is NOT NECESSARY to print out a running total with each user input.

#point = 4
# base case
def average():
    if num == "":
        print "lol"

# recursive case 
def summation(num):
    num = raw_input("Next number: ")
    if num == "":
        return avg 
    else:
        return num 



def odd(num):
    if num / 2 == float(num)
